Javascript Challenge


Important Notes:

1.)  I used the html that was provided and made changes to it in order to add the features that I needed.  I added a "Reset Table" button...and I also added two more filter
fields that people can search with.  The filters I added were "City" and "State."

2.)  I created a function to populate the table with our data...and then I created a separate function to filter the data and replace the table.  The function that runs when
you press the "Filter Table" button has the other function nested inside of the code.

3.)  With the reset button, the filtered data is removed and the table is replaced with the original data.

4.)  I included "toLowerCase" on the filters just to prevent the code from breaking if people put in upper case letters.

5.)  The function that runs on the "button click" actually sets all of the data to a variable...and then with each filter (if statement) it narrows it down to what is requested.

6.)  Lastly, I created a "css" file in order to change the fonts, colors, and layout of the index.html.

Thank you!
